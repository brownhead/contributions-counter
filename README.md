# Contribution Counter

This is a Python library that provides easy access to the grid of contributions displayed on every user's GitHub profile page.

The contributions are pulled from GitHub by parsing the HTML of the account's GitHub page, thus this library is extremely susceptible to breaking if GitHub changes their underlying markup.

## Motivation

I created this library because I entered into a bet with a friend of mine regarding who could maintiain the longest streak of GitHub contributions and I am determined to win. This library will be used towards this goal.
